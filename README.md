# Sales_Data-Analysis_with_SQL

Repository containing a T-SQL script file with a Sales data analysis from the AdventureWorks sample data. [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms) offers the AdventureWorks data set to provide a sample database, data warehouse, and OLAP cube.<br>

### Project Objective<br>

This Sales data analysis was completed for self-learning purpose and to practice my skills with T-SQL queries. I have also restored the AdventureWorks data warehouse into SQL server 2019 using the graphical interface (GUI) in SQL Server Management Studio.<br>

### In this project I was able to: <br />

Retrieve data from the AdventureWork database;<br />

Join data with other related tables;<br />

Aggregate data; and<br />

Perform complex analysis using CTE and Rank.<br />

### Conclusion:<br />

I have always enjoyed working with SQL and I was impressed with its capability to perform queries in large datasets.  Working with SSMS was easy and really helped to optimize my queries and speed data processing.
