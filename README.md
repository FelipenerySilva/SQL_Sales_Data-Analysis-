# SQL_Sales_Data-Analysis

SQL is the most universal of data science and programmam languages.<br />
This repository contains a SQL sript file with a series of queries that will show valuable information to analyse the Adventure Works Sales Data.

The Adventure Works database sample can be found here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms]  

### In this project I was able to: <br />
Retrieve data from the AdventureWork database;<br />
Join data with other related tables;<br />
Aggregate data; and<br />
Perform complex analysis using CTE and Rank.
